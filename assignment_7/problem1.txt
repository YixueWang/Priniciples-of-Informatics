For the problem 1-1, I create a dictionary to store the relationship between the agencies of NYPD, DOT, DOB, TLC, DPR and the complaints\'92 volume of each agency. When plot the histogram, first create a list of count according to the order of NYPD, DOT, DOB, TLC, DPR. Then by using the plt.bar() to create histograms of each agency.\
\
For the problem 1-2, I first create a dictionary storing agency and each agency\'92s complaint\'92s volume. And sort the dictionary in terms of number of complaints. Then create two lists and store the agency\'92s name and complaints volume accordingly. And by using pandas, series.plot,  to create histograms.\

For the first figure, we can notice that DOT has the largest amount of complaints from jun/01/2013 to aug/31/2013 and TLC has the lowest amount of complaints from jun/01/2013 to aug/31/2013 among the five agencies. I think the reason why DOT has a lots of complaints is the department is responsible for the whole city\'92s transportation which is related to every one\'92s life. On the contrary, TLC is responsible for Taxi, and this only plays an small part in every one\'92s life, and it is less likely for everyone to involve in taxi-related issues, find disturbing issues and call 311 to complain.\
\
For the second figure, HPD has the largest amount of complaints among the all agencies (much larger than any other agencies). larger than the 2nd agency at 160% capacity.\
\
And if we input a large number, we can notice that the top-9 agencies\'92s volume of complaints are larger than10000. And the following agencies have really small amount of complaints, around hundreds of complaints. on the contrary, the agencies which are among the top-9 agencies, have a really large amount of complaints, mainly between 10000 to 100000( HPD is the biggest, which is larger than 100000)\
\
For the officers, they should be aware of this huge difference and especially for those agencies which have large amounts of complaints, they should take a look at the complaint type and figure out why they have so many complaints.}
