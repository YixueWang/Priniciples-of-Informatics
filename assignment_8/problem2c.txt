\f0\fs24 \cf0 When the time is close to deadline, the amount of work is increasing a lot. ( Number of actions are increasing) \
When there is no assignment, there is almost no students who submit their homework. Only when the time is approaching, they may start to work on them. Longer the time period between two assignments is, less students will start to work on the assignment early. (2007-10-05 to 2007-10-16)\
However students will keep working on assignments if the time period is really short.\
\
Students prefer to work at night. We can see that even when the due time is passed, there are still many students submit their homework( especially for assignment 3, and 4). I assume maybe there are some late permissions for late submisions.\
